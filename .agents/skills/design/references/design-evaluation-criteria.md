# Design Evaluation Criteria

Score 1–5 on each criterion.

## 1) Visual Hierarchy
Is the most important information the most prominent? Does the eye know where to go?

## 2) Consistency with Design System
Do colors, typography, and spacing match `docs/UI_DESIGN.md`? No ad-hoc values.

## 3) Mobile Layout
Does the layout work at 375px? No horizontal overflow. Tap targets ≥ 44px.

## 4) Interaction States
Are all states handled: default, hover/focus, loading, empty, error?

## 5) Accessibility
Sufficient color contrast (≥ 4.5:1 for body text). Keyboard navigable. Semantic HTML.

## 6) Content Clarity
Is the copy clear and concise? No jargon. Action labels describe the action.

## 7) Whitespace
Is whitespace used intentionally? No cramped sections. No excessive padding.

## 8) Component Reuse
Are shadcn-style primitives used? No new component library introduced.

## 9) Performance Perception
Does the design account for loading states? No layout shift on data load.
