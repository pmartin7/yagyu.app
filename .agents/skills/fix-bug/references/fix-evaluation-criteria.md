# Bug Fix Evaluation Criteria

Score the proposed fix 1–5 on each criterion.

## 1) Simplicity
Is the fix as small as possible? Penalise fixes that touch unrelated code.

## 2) Maintainability
Will the fix be readable and understandable six months from now?

## 3) YAGNI
Does the fix introduce any abstraction not required to correct the bug?

## 4) Separation of Concerns
Does the fix put logic in the right place (controller vs service vs guard vs lib)?

## 5) Performance
Does the fix introduce any performance regression (extra queries, re-renders, blocking calls)?

## 6) Correctness
Does the fix actually solve the root cause, or does it patch a symptom?
