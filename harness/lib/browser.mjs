/**
 * Shared Chromium launcher for the harnesses.
 *
 * Two agent-sandbox quirks otherwise make every harness run re-download ~150MB
 * of Chromium, and this module exists to neutralise both:
 *
 *  1. The sandbox points PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH at a per-session temp
 *     directory, so nothing installed ever survives the session. We pin it back
 *     to Playwright's own platform default, which one `playwright install`
 *     populates for good and which CI can cache.
 *  2. The sandbox blocks sysctl, so `os.cpus()` returns [] — and Playwright
 *     detects Apple Silicon with `cpus().some(c => c.model.includes('Apple'))`.
 *     With no CPUs it concludes mac-x64 and hunts for an x64 build that never
 *     matches the arm64 one on disk. PLAYWRIGHT_HOST_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE is
 *     Playwright's own escape hatch for exactly this.
