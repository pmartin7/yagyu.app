 * Installs the Chromium build the harnesses need, into the one location they

 * Run this once per machine. Prefer it over a bare `pnpm exec playwright
 * install`, which obeys whatever PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH the shell happens to
 * carry — in agent sandboxes that is a per-session temp directory, so the
 * download is thrown away the moment the session ends.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm playwright:install
